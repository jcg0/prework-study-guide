# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

A webpage to display the knowledge gained while working through the prework content for the Bootcamp. It is helpful to keep all the notes that have been taken to be kept in one place for easy access. During the prework I learned how to create HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files and how to incorporate each file with each other. I learned how to deploy my webpage using Github Pages.

This webpage can be used as a document to show the notes that have been taken during the bootcamp prework. When the DevTools console is opened you can see the JavaScript that is written and applied to the HTML document. It will list the prework topics and then chose one of the topics randomly to study.
